  <h1>Creating your study space</h1>
Your study space is critical to your ability to study effectively. This doesn't
 necessarily imply that you have to find a place that's completely silent and
 set it up as your study area, but it does mean you should find a place to study
  that fits your specific personality  learning style Creating a study environment
   that worksfor you will help you to focus on your   learning and enjoy your
   studies. Checking the personal resources available   to you at home, at
    university and other places, as well as within yourself, can reveal any
    aspects you need to focus on. These resources could include a
     space to work, equipment, support people and your own skills, attitudes and
      study habits. This section shares ideas on creating your work space,
      organising resources and doing your best to ensure you donâ€™t lose your
