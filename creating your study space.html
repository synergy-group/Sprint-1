    <h4>Managing your studies</h4>
  <h5>Creating your study space</h5>
<p4>Your study space is critical to your ability to study effectively. This doesn't
 necessarily imply that you have to find a place that's completely silent and
 set it up as your study area, but it does mean you should find a place to study
  that fits your specific personality  learning style Creating a study environment
   that worksfor you will help you to focus on your   learning and enjoy your
   studies. Checking the personal resources available   to you at home, at
    university and other places, as well as within yourself, can reveal any
    aspects you need to focus on. These resources could include a
     space to work, equipment, support people and your own skills </p4>

<h5>creating your study space</h5>
          <p4>Make sure your study area is comfortable. It is very important to
             set up your computer and chair in a way that won't harm your hands,
              wrists and neck. Make sure Your chair and monitor are the right height
              and lend themselves to a proper ergonomic position for hours of
              comfortable studying. </p4>
              <p4>Evaluate your personality and preferences. Discover whether or
                 not you are vulnerable to noise and other distractions. Also
                 determine if you work better by sitting quietly for a long period
                  of time or if you need to take short breaks once in awhile and
                   then return to your work.</p4>
                   <h5>Organising your resources</h5>
                   <p>stop using bindersInstead of using binders or paper files, set up digital files. On your computer, create a folder and name it with this school year. Then, within this main folder, create a separate folder for each type of resource you would normally save as a paper file.

Scan the resources that pass the test from number one and save each into its appropriate folder. Save a copy to a personal flash drive so that you have your resources with you at both home and work.</p>

   <h5>Dont loose your work</h5>
 <p>Having a backup of your work is the most important thing you can do to protect your data.
    We provide recommendations for personal computers and Reed-owned computers below.
Just storing your files in a different location than your operating system isn't enough; you need to create regular backups of your files.
