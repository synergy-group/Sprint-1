    <h3>Time management</h3>
    <p>Time management is an integral part of any major project, including studying for a degree. Therefore, you need to manage your time effectively in order to sustain a balance between study, work and other life commitments.  Planning your time increases your chances of enjoying life as a student and helps to reduce stress about assignment deadlines and exams.

Good time management requires that you take a pro-active approach – know yourself, your goals, strengths and weaknesses – know how you are currently using your time and how you need to reorganise it. Try using the weekly and semester planners provided below and once completed, display them in a prominent place at home where everyone who needs to can see them.
