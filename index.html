    <h1>MANAGING YOUR STUDIES</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to managing your studies</h2>
    <p>Successfully completing a university degree does not happen by accident.
       You need to manage three particular aspects of life to be successful at
        university â€“ time, everyday life and all its demands, and the physical
         and digital environment in which you study. Time management is important
         because part of your responsibility at university is to read, to research
         and to write independently. You will need to plan carefully to ensure that
         you submit all of your assignments on time and attend all lectures and
         tutorials whether on campus or online. In addition, you need to balance
         university commitments with family and work commitments. Included in this
          is maintaining a healthy mind and a healthy body by taking time away
         from study for recreation and developing social relationships as well as
         eating a well-balanced diet. You will need to find a physical place to
          study and store your materials in a logical and neat fashion. Finally,
           you need to know and understand how to operate in a computer environment,
            especially saving, protecting and storing your digital files. You can
             find some information and ideas for managing your studies on the right
